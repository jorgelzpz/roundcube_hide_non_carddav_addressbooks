Roundcube plugin: hide non CardDAV addressbook entries
======================================================

This Roundcube plugin is meant to be used alongside the
[rcmcarddav](https://github.com/blind-coder/rcmcarddav) plugin.

Use this plugin to make Roundcube completely ignore any addressbooks that are
not provided by the rcmcarddav plugin.


Installation
------------

Download/clone this repository and rename the resulting directory to
`hide_non_carddav_addressbooks`. Then move it inside the `plugins/` directory
and enable it inside the `main.inc.php` configuration file from Roundcube.
